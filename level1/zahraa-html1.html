  <p><b>photography<b> began with early experiments in the 17th century like <q><b>like Johann Heinrich Schulze</q> and<q> Thomas Wedgwood</b></q>, leading to the invention of the daguerreotype in 1839. The 19th century saw the expansion of photography through processes like wet plate collodion. Roll film and the Kodak camera brought photography to the masses in the late 1800s. The transition to color photography happened in the early 20th century. The digital revolution emerged in the late 20th century, transforming photography. Mobile photography and social media became prominent in the 21st century, shaping modern photography practices.</p>
<h3>johann Heinrich Schulze </h3>

<p>johann Heinrich Schulze (1687â€“1744) was one of the major pioneers of photography. In 1719, he discovered that silver nitrate was sensitive to light, and worked out that silver salts changed color in sunlight. This discovery is still considered to be one of the most important principles when saving images on negative film.</p>
